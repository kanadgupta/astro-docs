You can deploy your Astro project to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a platform for running full stack apps and databases close to your users.

Astro applications can to be served as either **static pages** _or_ with **server-side rendering (SSR)**. On this page you'll find guides to deploying both varieties.

## How to deploy

1. [Install flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/), your Fly.io app command center.
2. [Sign up to Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/#first-time-or-no-fly-account-sign-up-for-fly) if you haven't already.
3. Run the command below.

    ```bash
      fly launch
    ```

flyctl will automatically detect Astro, configure the correct settings, build your image, and deploy it to the Fly.io platform. If you don't already have a Dockerfile, `fly launch` will generate one for you, as well as prepare a `fly.toml` file.

### SSR Setup

To deploy with SSR support, make sure you first set up the [`@astrojs/node`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) adapter (with standalone mode) in your Astro project. flyctl will automatically detect this during `fly launch` and if no existing Dockerfile is found, it will generate a new one with the appropriate start command and environment variables.

## Generating your Astro Dockerfile

As discussed earlier, running `fly launch` will generate a Dockerfile for you if one does not already exist. Separately, you can also generate your Dockerfile using [Dockerfile generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flydotio/dockerfile). Once installed, it can be run using `npx dockerfile` for Node applications or `bunx dockerfile` for Bun applications.
